Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy that satirizes school life with sharp wit and surprising realismâ€”more so than comparable shows like 'Teachers'. As a teacher with 35 years of experience, I found the students' pettiness, financial struggles, and absurd situations all too familiar. I was reminded immediately of real classrooms.
