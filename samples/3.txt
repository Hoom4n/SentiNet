Well, this film is a difficult one really. To be straight, it doesn’t contain a riveting story, nor does it make you 'want' to know how it’ll end... but I’ve never been as tense and jumpy in my life! This film delivers the jumps and thrills. Not a blockbuster, not high budget—but definitely effective.
